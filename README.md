# Ada Jumpstart Solutions

These are my personal solutions to the challenges posted in the Ada Jumpstart curriculum which can be found [here](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start)

Challenge 1 MadLibs:
Create a madlibs program that accepts user input, inserts it into a paragraph, and prints out the results

Challenge 2 Candy:
Create a virtual candy machine that prompts the user for how much money the have, provides them a list of choices, and calculates their change.
