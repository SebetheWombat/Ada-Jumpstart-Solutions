# Ada Jumpstart Solutions

These are my personal solutions to the challenges posted in the [Ada Jumpstart](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start) curriculum.

Challenge 1: MadLibs  
Create a madlibs program that accepts user input, inserts it into a paragraph, and prints out the results.

Challenge 2: Candy  
Create a virtual candy machine that prompts the user for how much money the have, provides them a list of choices, and calculates their change.

Challenge 3: Election  
Create an electronic election program that tracks votes and determines a winner. I chose to have the election between superheros but the program accepts write in votes. Feel free to play around with it or make suggestions!
